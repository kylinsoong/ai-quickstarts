== Gemini 

=== API & SDK

Gemini is a family of generative AI models developed by Google DeepMind that is designed for *multimodal* use cases. The Gemini API gives you access to the `Gemini Pro Vision model` and `Gemini Pro models`.
 
* *Gemini 1.0 Pro model* - Designed to handle natural language tasks, multi-turn text and code chat, and code generation.
* *Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision model* - Supports multimodal prompts. You can include text, images, and video in your prompt requests and get text or code responses.

=== Multimodality

Most of LLMs are text-only, or only focus on one aspects, eg, LLM for Text Generation, or LLM for for Image/Vedio Generation, Gemini Pro Vision's multimodality which means use one LLM can either generate Text, or Image/Vedio.

Gemini Pro Vision's multimodality use-cases including:

* Detecting objects in photos
* Understanding screens and interfaces
* Understanding of drawing and abstraction
* Understanding charts and diagrams
* Recommendation of images based on user preferences
* Comparing images for similarities, anomalies, or differences
* Generating a video description
* Extracting tags of objects throughout a video
* Extracting highlights/messaging of a video

[source,python]

[source, bash]
*Prompt*
----
How much should I pay for the fruits?

*Image 2:*

image::https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/img/gemini/multimodality_usecases_overview/pricelist.jpg[]

[source, bash]
*Response*
----
Step 1: There are two bananas and two apples in the first image.
Step 2: Two bananas and two apples.
Step 3: Apples: $1.50 per item, Bananas: $0.80 per item
Step 4: Two bananas * $0.80 per banana = $1.60
         Two apples * $1.50 per apple = $3.00
Step 5: $1.60 + $3.00 = $4.60

Therefore, you should pay $4.60 for the fruits.

*Prompt*
----
Document the entities and relationships in this ER diagram.
----

image::https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/img/gemini/multimodality_usecases_overview/er.png[]

[source, bash]
*Response*
----
**Entities:**

* **Category:** Represents different categories of items.
    * Attributes: `category`, `category_name`
* **Vendor:** Represents different vendors supplying items.
    * Attributes: `vendor_no`, `vendor`
* **Item:** Represents different items sold.
    * Attributes: `item`, `description`, `pack`, `liter_size`
* **Sales:** Represents sales transactions.
    * Attributes: `date`, `store`, `category`, `vendor_no`, `item`, `state_btl_cost`, `btl_price`, `bottle_qty`, `total`
* **Convenience_store:** Represents convenience stores.
    * Attributes: `store`
* **Store:** Represents stores.
    * Attributes: `store`, `name`, `address`, `city`, `zipcode`, `store_location`, `county_number`
* **County:** Represents counties.
    * Attributes: `county_number`, `county`

**Relationships:**

* **Category to Sales:** One-to-many relationship. A category can have many sales transactions, but a sales transaction belongs to only one category.
* **Vendor to Sales:** One-to-many relationship. A vendor can have many sales transactions, but a sales transaction belongs to only one vendor.
* **Item to Sales:** One-to-many relationship. An item can be involved in many sales transactions, but a sales transaction involves only one item.
* **Sales to Convenience_store:** One-to-one relationship. A sales transaction occurs at only one convenience store, and a convenience store can have only one sales transaction at a time.
* **Store to County:** One-to-one relationship. A store is located in only one county, and a county can have only one store.
* **Item to County:** One-to-many relationship. An item can be sold in many counties, but a county can have many items sold in it.

**Note:** The relationship between `Sales` and `Convenience_store` is represented by a diamond with a "o" on one side, indicating a weak entity relationship. This means that `Convenience_store` is dependent on `Sales` for its existence.

|Recommendations based on multiple images

*Prompt*
----
Which of these glasses you recommend for me based on the shape of my face?
I have an oval shape face.

[source, json]
*Response*
----
{
  "recommendation": "Glasses 2",
  "reasoning": {
    "Glasses 1": "Square frames can make an oval face appear wider.  The angular shape clashes with the natural curves of an oval face. ",
    "Glasses 2": "Round frames are a great choice for oval faces because they create a nice contrast and balance the face's natural curves. Round frames can also make the face appear more symmetrical." 
  }
}

|Time Series Data
|Time series data consists of sequences of data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. Each data point typically includes a timestamp and a value, which can represent various metrics like temperature, stock prices, or server performance. This type of data is crucial for analyzing trends, patterns, and changes over time.

|TensorFlow Extended SDK
|The TensorFlow Extended (TFX) SDK is designed to help you build production-ready machine learning pipelines. It provides a set of components that manage different aspects of the machine learning workflow, from data validation to model serving.

=== Usage Case

[cols="5a"]
|===
|Automated quality control in manufacturing

|Background: 

* A semiconductor manufacturing company, eed to create a real-time application that automates the quality control process. 
* High definition images of each semiconductor are taken at the end of the assembly line in real time. 
* The photos are uploaded to a Cloud Storage bucket along with tabular data that includes each semiconductor's batch number, serial number, dimensions, and weight.

|Key Requirement: *Configure model training and serving while maximizing model accuracy.*

|Solution:

1.  Use Vertex AI Data Labeling Service to label the images, and train an AutoML image classification mode
2. Deploy the model, and configure Pub/Sub to publish a message when an image is categorized into the failing class.
