|Time Series Data
|Time series data consists of sequences of data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. Each data point typically includes a timestamp and a value, which can represent various metrics like temperature, stock prices, or server performance. This type of data is crucial for analyzing trends, patterns, and changes over time.

|TensorFlow Extended SDK
|The TensorFlow Extended (TFX) SDK is designed to help you build production-ready machine learning pipelines. It provides a set of components that manage different aspects of the machine learning workflow, from data validation to model serving.

|===
|Automated quality control in manufacturing

|Background: 

* A semiconductor manufacturing company, eed to create a real-time application that automates the quality control process. 
* High definition images of each semiconductor are taken at the end of the assembly line in real time. 
* The photos are uploaded to a Cloud Storage bucket along with tabular data that includes each semiconductor's batch number, serial number, dimensions, and weight.

|Key Requirement: *Configure model training and serving while maximizing model accuracy.*

|Solution:

1.  Use Vertex AI Data Labeling Service to label the images, and train an AutoML image classification mode
2. Deploy the model, and configure Pub/Sub to publish a message when an image is categorized into the failing class.
