== Objectives

The Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer training and exam are intended for individuals with a strong technical background and hands-on experience in machine learning (ML) who want to demonstrate their expertise in designing, building, and deploying machine learning solutions on Google Cloud.

The exam validates a candidateâ€™s ability to complete the following course objectives:

* Describe how to develop and implement machine learning solutions using low-code tools and services on Google Cloud.
* Explain how to effectively manage data, prototype models, and collaborate within and across teams to build robust ML solutions.
* Determine how to scale ML prototypes into production-ready models by selecting appropriate frameworks, training effectively, and choosing optimal hardware.
* Describe how to deploy and scale ML models in production using various serving strategies and infrastructure on Google Cloud.
* Explain how to automate and orchestrate end-to-end ML pipelines to streamline model development, deployment, and retraining.
* Identify the key tasks and considerations for monitoring, testing, and troubleshooting ML solutions to ensure performance, reliability, and responsible AI practices.
