== About BigQuery ML

* BigQuery Machine Learning (BigQuery ML) enables users to create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery using SQL queries.
* The goal of BigQuery ML is to democratise machine learning by enabling SQL practitioners to build models using their existing tools and to increase development speed by eliminating the need for data movement.

== Data

=== Create a dataset

* Create a new dataset within your project by clicking the three dots next to your project ID in the Explorer section, then clicking on Create dataset.
