|Name |Note

|Resource Group
|
* Resource Group in Azure is to act as a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. 
* Resource groups can include all the resources for the solution or only those resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide how you want to allocate resources to resource groups based on what makes the most sense for your organization.

|Workspaces
|A workspace provides a centralized place to keep track of all the artifacts you create while performing machine learning experiments.

|Azure AI Bot Service
|Azure AI Bot Service provide a platform for conversational artificial intelligence (AI), which designates the ability of software agents to participate in a conversation. 

|AI Hub
|
* An AI hub provides a collaborative workspace for AI solution development and management. 
* An Azure AI hub can host one or more projects. Each project encapsulates the tools and assets used to create a specific AI solution.
* An Azure AI hub is the foundation for AI development projects on Azure, and enables you to define shared assets that can be used across multiple projects. 

|Computer Vision Tagging
|Computer Vision Tagging involves associating an image with metadata that summarizes the attributes of the image.

|Face identification
|Face identification in the Azure AI Face service can address one-to-many matching of one face in an image to a set of faces in a secure repository. 

|Face verification 
|Face verification has the capability for one-to-one matching of a face in an image to a single face from a secure repository or a photo to verify whether they are the same individual. 

|System messages
|System messages should be used to set the context for the model by describing expectations. Based on system messages, the model knows how to respond to prompts. 

|Embeddings
|
* Embeddings is an Azure OpenAI model that converts text into numerical vectors for analysis. 
* Embeddings can be used to search, classify, and compare sources of text for similarity.

|Vectorization
|Vectorization captures semantic relationships between words by assigning them to locations in n-dimensional space.

|Entity recognition
|Entity recognition includes the entity linking functionality that returns links to external websites to disambiguate terms (entities) identified in a text.

|Key phrase extraction
|Key phrase extraction evaluates the text of a document and identifies its main talking points.

|Universal Language Model
|The Universal Language Model used by the speech-to-text API is optimized for conversational and dictation scenarios.

|Custom Translator 
|Model training with a dictionary can be used with Custom Translator when you do not have enough parallel sentences to meet the 10,000 minimum requirements. 

|DALL-E
|DALL-E is a model that can generate images from natural language.

|Semantic segmentation
|Semantic segmentation provides the ability to classify individual pixels in an image depending on the object that they represent.

The concierge Paulette was extremely helpful. Sadly when we arrived the elevator was broken, but with Paulette's help we barely noticed this inconvenience.
She arranged for our baggage to be brought up to our room with no extra charge and gave us a free meal to refurbish all of the calories we lost from
walking up the stairs :). Can't say enough good things about my experience!
